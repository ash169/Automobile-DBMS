# Automobile DBMS

## Introduction

This project aims at efficient management of database of an automobile company.

## Features

The end-user on welcome screen is asked to identify himself/herself as administrator of thecompany or as a customer. Of course, while the former requires a unique password for access, the latter is subdivided into two new categories, namely new or old customer. An old customer has to enter the correct and unique Customer ID for access, while a new customer is asked to register himself/herself and is simultaneously
provided with a unique customer ID for future access.

## User Log In

The customer turned user is then asked if he/she would like to view the catalogue of the company or to directly search for the desired car using any of the three different search filters provided.

Thereafter, the customer is asked to enter the chassis no of the desired car as being displayed on the screen, which serves as an important parameter to generate the cash memo.

## Checkout Screen

The customer is finally provided with a memo screen which displays the details of the purchase and the net payable amount.
